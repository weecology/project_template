## Setup

If you are familiar with Git, feel free to fork or clone, and then modify the remote location as you desire.

If the above sounded like a bunch of jargon (which it was), here are some directions to setup a synced repo on GitHub using this template:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub in the usual way. [some directions]
2. Clone the new repository to your local machine in the usual way. [some directions]
3. Download this template as a zip file.
4. Unzip and then copy the folder contents into your new repository.
5. Run `git add .` to stage all the new files and `git commit` to commit those changes. (You'll be prompted for a commit message in the usual way.)
6. You should now have a synced repo that you can modify at your discretion!
